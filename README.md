# Gurobi-Steam-Turbogenerator-Optimization
This repository demonstrates the formulation and solution of a boiler–turbogenerator system optimization problem using the Gurobi solver. The project implements a linear programming model to minimize utility operating costs while satisfying steam and power balance constraints.
